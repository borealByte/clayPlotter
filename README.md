# 🗺️ clayPlotter: Modern Python Choropleth Mapping

Welcome to `clayPlotter`! 👋 This project is transforming the original script into a modern, installable Python package 📦 for creating beautiful choropleth maps 🎨.

Our goal is to build a robust, well-tested, and easy-to-use tool following modern development practices.

## ✨ Project Goals & Phases

We're tackling this modernization in phases:

*   🏗️ **Phase 1: Setup & Restructuring:** Laying the groundwork with proper packaging (`uv`), versioning (`Commitizen`), and a clean project structure. ✅
*   🛠️ **Phase 2: Refactoring & TDD:** Carefully rebuilding functionality using Test-Driven Development (TDD) to ensure reliability and maintainability. We're focusing on object-oriented design and manageable code modules. 🧪
*   🚀 **Phase 3: CI/CD & Finalization:** Implementing Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using GitHub Actions to automate testing and builds. We'll also add essential documentation. ⚙️

## 🔮 Future Plans

*   Publishing to PyPI for easy installation.
*   Adding more advanced documentation.
*   Exploring new features!

Stay tuned for updates! 🎉
