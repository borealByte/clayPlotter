# MCP Server dependencies
mcp_server # The library for the MCP server itself
fastapi
uvicorn[standard] # Includes standard ASGI server features
pydantic
pydantic-settings
# No need for mcp_server as a dependency since we're building it into clayPlotter

# Note: clayPlotter itself is not listed here as this file
# is typically used to install dependencies *for* the package,
# not the package itself during development installation.

# Testing dependencies
pytest
pytest-asyncio # For testing async FastAPI code if needed
importlib-resources; python_version < '3.9' # Backport for older Python versions
